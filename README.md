# BankSimulation
Project created for class.
## DESCRIPTION
For this assignment, you will write a program that simulates a line at a bank. The bank opens at 9 AM and closes at 5 PM. In between, a number of customers arrive throughout the day. Each customerâ€™s business at the bank takes a different amount of time to complete. The bank is small so it only has one teller for all customers. If one customer is at the teller, and others come in, they wait in line in the order they entered.

Your program will read in an input file with one line for each customer. Each line has three fields: customer name, the time they came in (in 24 hour format), and the number of minutes the customer will need with the teller.  Customers cannot arrive after the bank closes at 5:00 PM (1700), but if a customer is already in line when the bank closes, they will not be turned away. No two customers will arrive at the same time.

Your program will simulate the activity of the bank in a given day. It will print out the times customers get in line and the times that they are done with their business. Your program will also print out the average waiting time for all customers (including both the time in line and at the teller). Here is the sample output for the input file above.

Average wait time is 1.72973 minutes.

## Details
    Your program should produce an error message if the user does if the file does not exist.
    You must use a queue to store customers that are waiting in line.
    The queue must be the stl
    You must use functions to processing inputting elements into the queue, processing elements removing from the queue, and reading the file
    You can perform the simulation however you like, but I would recommend having a loop that counts through the minutes of the day, from 9:00 on, and decide what must be done each minute.
## General Requirements
    No global variables other than constants.
    Your source code should be readable and reasonably indented.
    You must provide comments in your code.
